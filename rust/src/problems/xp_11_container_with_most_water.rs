 * Testcase Example:  '[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]'
 *
 * You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical
 * lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i^th line are (i, 0) and (i,
 * height[i]).
 *
 * Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the
 * container contains the most water.
 *
 * Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 *
 * Notice that you may not slant the container.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 * Output: 49
 * Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array
 * [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the
 * container can contain is 49.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: height = [1,1]
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == height.length
 * 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
 *
